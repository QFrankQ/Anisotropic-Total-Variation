# Anisotropic-Total-Variation
This is my final project for CS 590OP, Applied Numerical Optimization.  
The project is on Anisotropic Total Variation denoising on 2D images, where the ADMM algorithm and proximal gradient descent is used.  
The algorithm results are shown in the PDF file.  
The project is co-created with 2 other group members; I lead all the mathematical derivations and algorithm implementation.
